The high concentration of Lycra spandex means that <strong>Miraclesuit&reg;</strong>s keep their shape... and yours.</p>

No more bulky wire construction that pokes through after a few wearings. <strong>Miraclesuit&reg;</strong> has a bra constructed specially for you, no matter what support you need.</p>
