				<h3 class="paragraphs">					
					<p>The <strong>Miraclesuit&reg;</strong> heritage of fit, form, and function begins with out unique and innovative fabric, <strong>Miratex&reg;</strong>. Exclusively ours, this fabric delivers three times the control of ordinary swimwear fabrics, without relying on inner linings or constrictive control panels to shape and trim. The high concentration of Lycra spandex means that <strong>Miraclesuit&reg;</strong>s keep their shape... and yours.</p>
					<p>We utilize the best in bra support, including our newest innovation, a one piece molded bra construction that has underwire built into a foam bra. No more bulky wire construction that pokes through after a few wearings. <strong>Miraclesuit&reg;</strong> has a bra constructed specially for you, no matter what support you need.</p>
